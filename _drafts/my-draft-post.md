# This is a Draft Post

This post is in the _drafts folder. It doesn't need a date in the filename.

When you're ready to publish it, you can:
1. Move it to the _posts directory
2. Rename it to include the date (YYYY-MM-DD-title.md format)

Or you can just keep it in the _drafts directory and it will be visible when you run Jekyll with the --drafts flag.
