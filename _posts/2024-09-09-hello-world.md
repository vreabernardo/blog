# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post using Jekyll and the Minima theme!

## What is this blog about?

This blog will be a place for me to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings. I'll be posting about various topics that interest me, including:

- Technology
- Programming
- Personal projects
- Books I'm reading
- And much more!

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that allows me to write content in Markdown, which is then converted to a static website. Some of the benefits include:

1. **Simplicity**: No database to maintain
2. **Speed**: Static sites load quickly
3. **Security**: Fewer attack vectors compared to dynamic sites
4. **Version Control**: Easy to track changes with Git

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
